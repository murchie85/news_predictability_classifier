# New Predictability Classifier
  

This project runs a ridge classifier model to train upon historical news data, to predict which news agency published  a given headline.  (you can produce your own from my other project News_Source_compiler).

## Overview

In order to get this working, you will need to collate your own news data, it is too big to store in this repository but you can contact me for the payload or create your own by working with my [interface](https://github.com/murchie85/News_Source_compiler) to build your own data or work direclty with **newsAPI** .
